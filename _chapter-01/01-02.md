title: "Navigation"

In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to navigate on the **Canvas**. We will create first **Frame** and learn different techniques to move around your designs. At first, it might feel a bit overwhelming, but soon you will perfect it.

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to freely _zoom_ and _pan_ the **Canvas**, and you will be in the control of what you see.

## Create a Frame

Frames usually represent single view of your design, so they should reflect the user's screen.

1. From the **Tool bar** in the top-left corner, choose **Frame** tool (**#**-like icon).
   > I highly encourage you to start using keyboard shortcuts from the very begining. In this case, just hit **`F`** on the keyboard.
2. From the right panel (**Design**), under `Phone` section, choose `Android Large` frame. White rectangular frame should appear in the center of the **Canvas**.
   > We will use this kind of frame, since it's quite popular and easy-to-start-with for mobile web design.
3. Take a look at the left panel (Layers). You should see the newly created frame listed there.

## Zoom in & out

There are multiple ways to _zoom_ in Figma and they depend on the device you use (e.g. mouse, trackpad) and your individual preference.

- If you're using **mouse**, just hold down **`⌘`** and _scroll up_ or _scroll down_.
- If you're using **trackpad**, just _pinch-in_ or _pinch-out_.

## Pan

As with _zooming_, _panning_ the **Canvas** can be done in multiple ways.

- If you're using **mouse**, just hold **`Space`** and then **`drag`**.
- If you're using **trackpad**, just **`pan`** (move) using two fingers (without _clicking_).
- If you're using **Magic Mouse**, just **`pan`** using one finger (without _clicking_).

## Experiment with zooming and panning

Now, when you know the methods for zooming and pannig, use them to get used to it.

> None of these actions change the actual size of the newly created **Frame**. It just controls how it looks in the so-called viewport (visible part of the **Canvas**).

1. **Zoom out**, so the **Frame** in the viewport is small as mouse cursor.
2. **Zoom in**, so the **Frame** fits the viewport entirely.
3. **Zoom out** a bit, so **Frame** has some space around.
4. **Pan** around, so the **Frame** is visible in any corner of the viewport.
5. At the end, press **`⇧`****`1`** to **zoom to fit** all visible layers (we have one so far) in the viewport.

And that's all for this lesson. If you don't feel familiar with zooming and panning yet, just spend some more time experimenting with it.
