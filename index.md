# Figma Essentials

Welcome to the Figma Essentials guide!

This guide will take you through the basics of Figma, including how to **create views** from scratch using all **essential tools**. We will also cover some advanced features such as **auto layout**, **components**, **variants**, and how to make the most of **component properties**.

In the last part of this guide, you will learn how to make your designs interactive thanks to Figma's **prototypin g** capabilities.

Throughout the entire guide, you will be creating your own **mobile portfolio website** that you will be able to share with others as well.

Whether you're new to Figma or simply looking to brush up on your skills, this guide will provide you with the knowledge and resources you need to become a Figma pro. **Let's get started!**
